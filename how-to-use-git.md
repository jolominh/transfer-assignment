# How to use `git`
1. Initialize a repository with `git init`
2. Stage your files with `git add <path to file or directory>`
3. Whenever you made a substantial change, put it into the history with `git commit -m ""`
4. See your history with `git log`
5. Move around (history and branches!) with `git checkout <main or code from git log>`
6. Create new branches with `git checkout -b <name of new branch>`
7. To collaborate, first `git pull` others changes, then `git push` yours
